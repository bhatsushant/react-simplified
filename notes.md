## JSX Basics

- Creating HTML elements using 'React.createElement(..)' is a long and tedious process especially when creating nested components. This is where JSX makes life easier
- For an input element, once you set a _value={something}_ you cannot change that value. If you do want to change it however, use the property _defaultValue_ instead which is React specific
- JSX elements can be stored as variables and then used as JavaScript using {}
- You can return only one element inside _return_.
- {undefined}, {null} and {false} will return absolutely nothing
